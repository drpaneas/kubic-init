# Building

A simple `make` should be enough. This should compile [the main
function](cmd/kubic-init/main.go) and generate a `kubic-init` binary as
well as a _Docker_ image.

## Project structure

This project follows the conventions presented in the [standard Golang
project](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

## Dependencies

* `go >= 1.11`

For running the `kubic-init` (either locally, in a container or in a Terraform
deployment) please make sure the `kubelet` version running in the host system
is the same `kubic-init` was compiled against.

Note: 
We use golang modules but you still need to work inside your $GOPATH for developing `kubic-init`.
Working outside GOPATH is currently **not supported**

### Bumping the Kubernetes version used by `kubic-init`

Update the constraints in [`go.mod`](go.mod).

# Testing

Unit tests can be run using `make test`

## Run e2e tests

Once you have a deployed cluster, you can run the e2e tests on this cluster.

0) Deploy `make tf-full-apply`

1) Once you have the cluster in `kubic-init/tests` directory do :

```bash
SEEDER=192.168.122.73 ./run_suites.sh
```

Developing test guide is here: [E2E-TESTS](tests/README.md)

### Code Coverage:

Run first the tests. Then use `make coverage` for visualizing coverage.

Feel free to read more about this on : https://blog.golang.org/cover.


# Deploy  

There are multiple ways you can run the `kubic-init` for bootstrapping
and managinig your Kubernetes cluster:

### <a name="local"></a> ... in your local machine

You can run the `kubic-init` container locally with:

1. <a name="local-run"></a> `make local-run`. This will do the following things for you:

    * build the `kubic-init` executable
    * install a [_drop-in_](init/kubelet.drop-in.conf) unit for
    `kubelet`, so it can be started with the right parameters,
    stopping the `kubelet`.
    * run the `kubic-init` executable. This will generate a valid `kubeadm`
    configuration file, spawn a `kubeadm` process that will
    start all the control-plane containers (`etcd`, the API server,
    the controller manager and the scheduler) using the local
    container runtime.

2. `make docker-run`  will do basically the same as [`1`](#local-run) but the
   `kubic-init` will be run in a container:

    * it will prepare a `kubic-init` image
    * install the _drop-in_ (see [`1`](#local-run)).
    * run it with `docker`
      * mounting many local directories in the containar (so
      please review the `CONTAINER_VOLUMES` in the [`Makefile`](../Makefile)) 

Once you are done, you can `make local-reset`/`make docker-reset`
for stopping the control plane and removing all the leftovers.

### <a name="terraform"></a> ... with Terraform

The top-level Makefile includes some targets for creating a Kubic
cluster with the help of Terraform. All these targets have some common
steps, like:

  * starting `kubic`-based VMs
  * generating some config files from the [`cloud-init` templates](deployments/cloud-init)
  * copying some config files and drop-in units, install packages, etc...
  * copying the `kubic-init:latest` image and load it in the CRI.
  * starting the `kubic-init` container with `podman`.

These targets can be used for creating different configurations, where we can
have combinations of a seeder and regular nodes. For example:

1. for running a **full cluster** on the VMs:
   ```bash
   $ make tf-full-run TF_ARGS="-var nodes_count=0"
   ```
   This will start a cluster with a _seeder_ and a _node_.
   You can increase the number of nodes in the cluster (or customize any
   other variable in the [Terraform file](deployments/tf-libvirt-full/terraform.tf))
   passing some Terraform arguments:
   ```bash
   $ make tf-full-apply TF_ARGS="-var nodes_count=3"
   ```

   (see the [`f-libvirt-full`](deployments/tf-libvirt-full)
   directory for more details).

2. for running **only a seeder** on a VM:
   ```bash
   $ make tf-seeder-run
   ```
   This will start a VM where a `kubeadm` _seeder_ will be started. This
   will use a random _token_, so you will have to look for the token in
   the logs, so maybe it will be more convenient for you to specify
   a token with:
   ```bash
   $ env TOKEN=XXXX make tf-seeder-run
   ```
   Note that at this point you could start a node in your local
   development machine (as described in [previous section](#local))
   with just:
   ```bash
   $ env SEEDER=1.2.3.4 TOKEN=XXXX make local-run
   ```
   where `1.2.3.4` would be the IP address of the _seeder_ VM.

   (see the [`tf-libvirt-nodes`](deployments/tf-libvirt-nodes)
   directory for more details).

3. for running **only nodes** on the VMs:
   ```bash
   $ env TOKEN=XXXX make tf-nodes-run
   ```
   This will run a _one-node_ cluster (you could launch more nodes by
   setting the `nodes_count` Terraform variable, as described previously)
   that will connect to _seeder_ in the public IP address where Terraform
   is being run (you can use a different IP or name by setting the
   `SEEDER` env variable).
   
   This means that you will need to run a seeder in your local
   development machine as described in [previous section](#local).  

   (see the [`tf-libvirt-nodes`](deployments/tf-libvirt-nodes)
   directory for more details).
   
Once you are done with your cluster, a `make tf-*-destroy` will
destroy the cluster.
