# Note that the following stanza uses CircleCI 2.1 to make use of a Reusable Executor
# This allows defining a docker image to reuse across jobs.
# visit https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#authoring-reusable-executors to learn more.

version: 2.1

# ****** High-level description: *********
# 
# 1) We can have differents executors. at moment we need only golang one. Each worker can be a diff docker container or other resource type. (see upstream doc)
#
# 2) The first part jobs is just what this jobs/task execute.
#
# 3) At the end you have the workflow which allow us to define parallelism and dependencies between jobs/tasks
